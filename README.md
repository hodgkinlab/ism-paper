# Isotype Switching Model

This repository contains the data and codes used in the B cell isotype switching paper.
- Python v3.8.6
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the libraries necessary for the analysis. 'requirements.txt' file is located in "code" folder
- All figures are pre-generated in respective output folders e.g. FigX where X is the figure number. By default, the plots are saved in "out" folder and replace any existing files.


List of plots that correspond to the figure numbers in the paper
- Figure 4: Analysis of differential AID and GLT expression patterning during cell division facilitates a mathematical model that accurately predicts switching frequency.
- Repeat of Figure 4 analysis (not shown in the paper)
- Supplementary Figure 4: Molecular beacons targeting the Iy1 germline transcript.
- Figure 5: Isotype selection is independent of clonal lineage and conflicting CSR fate decisions are resolved by intracellular competition between GLTs.
- Supplementary Figure 5: RSS analysis of the model $\epsilon_1$ parameter.
- Supplementary Figure 7: Pre-division predictions of IgG1 and IgG2b switching under varied stimulation conditions using a mathematical model of competitive germline transcription.
