# Isotype Switching Model

This repository contains the data and codes used in the paper "A tunable, cell autonomous class switch mechanism complements heritable fate regulation to govern the emergence of isotype variegation within B cell clones".
- Python v3.8.6
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the libraries necessary for the analysis. 'requirements.txt' file is located in "code" folder
- All figures are pre-generated in respective output folders e.g. FigX where X is the figure number. By default, the plots are saved in "out" folder and replace any existing files.


List of plots that correspond to the figure numbers in the paper
- Figure 4: Analysis of differential AID and GLT expression patterning during cell division facilitates a mathematical model that accurately predicts switching frequency.
- Supplementary Figure 5: RSS analysis of the model $\epsilon_1$ parameter.
- Repeat of Figure 4 analysis (not shown in the paper)
- Figure 5: Isotype selection is independent of clonal lineage and conflicting CSR fate decisions are resolved by intracellular competition between GLTs.
- Supplementary Figure 7: Pre-division predictions of IgG1 and IgG2b switching under varied stimulation conditions using a mathematical model of competitive germline transcription.
- Supplementary Figure 4: Molecular beacons targeting the Iy1 germline transcript.
